  # Here's why we need the following ugly hack of waiting two seconds.
  #
  # This step (When I create a labor item...) enters hours and selects a user.
  # When doing this, for each change of these form field, an AJAX request will be sent to
  # attempt to calculate the total costs. The hours field only checks once per second
  # for a change (possibly to not send a request with each typed word), the user field
  # immediately sends the request.
  # This can lead to a scenario where our automation updates both hours and users field
  # before the first request is sent (as it may wait a second). Thus, the first request
  # already returns correct total costs and a following step finds the expected cost,
  # (e.g. "296.00 EUR") and cucumber continues to submit the form. Once the form is submitted,
  # the form field might detect a change and send an AJAX request (unnecessarily, but the
  # field obviously doesn't know that). The Rails application first processes the form,
  # adds a flash message to the session and returns a redirect to the show action.
  # When Rails processes the second request (the AJAX request, not the show action),
  # it clears the flash message without our base layout being able to show it.
  # The following request to the show action then can't show the flash message
  # and the expectation below for "Successful update" fails.
  #
  # Waiting 2 seconds gives the form field update JavaScript enough time to detect
  # a change and send the AJAX request before the form is submitted.
  #
  # This fixes the following sometimes failing scenarios:
  # * Budgets with cost items can be created adding new cost items
  # * Budgets can be updated updating existing cost items
  # * Budgets can be updated with new cost items
